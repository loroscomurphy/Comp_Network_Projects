# Project #1

#### Due Date

Due: 9/17, 2024

## Description

In this project, you will build a server/client program for remote file copy using the Berkely socket. The client program supports two commands: put and get. Their usages are as below:

```bash
put <filename>
get <filename>
```

The put command sends the file to the remote server. The get command retrieves the file from the server and stores it to the local computer.  The file can be either text or binary of arbitrary size.
